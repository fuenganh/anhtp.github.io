    "- Figure out what the input is and what n represents.\n",
    "- Express the maximum number of operations, the algorithm performs in terms of n.\n",
    "- Eliminate all excluding the highest order terms.\n",
    "- Remove all the constant factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, this asymptotic notation is used to measure and compare the worst-case scenarios of algorithms theoretically. For any algorithm, the Big-O analysis should be straightforward as long as we correctly identify the operations that are dependent on n, the input size. \n",

    "\n",
    "Big O analysis is important because it help us to solve all the drawbacks of experimental analysis:\n",
    "- Allows us to evaluate the relative efficiency of any two algorithms in a way that is independent of the hardware and software environment.\n",

    "- It gives an upper bound on the resources required by the algorithm. In the case of running time, the worst-case time complexity indicates the longest running time performed by an algorithm given any input of size n, and thus guarantees that the algorithm will finish in the indicated period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, it's not necessary to calculate exact run times when analyzing algorithms with Big O notation.\n",
    "- Big O notation is a measure of the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime, and it provides a way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms without considering the specific hardware or other implementation details.\n",
    "- To analyze an algorithm using Big O notation, you only need to determine the function that describes the algorithm's runtime in terms of the size of the input (n). This function is called the \"time complexity\" of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), this means that the runtime of the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input. If the time complexity is O(n^2), this means that the runtime grows as the square of the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is important to note that Big O notation only provides an upper bound on the runtime, so the actual runtime of an algorithm may be faster than the bound indicated by the Big O notation. However, it is a useful tool for comparing the relative efficiency of different algorithms and for identifying algorithms that may have unacceptable runtime performance for large inputs."
